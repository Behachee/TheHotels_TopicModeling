# TheHotels_TopicModeling

 The THEHOTEL.com team has approached you to gain deeper insights into guest experiences across their hotels. They are particularly interested in understanding the sentiments expressed in the reviews and identifying areas for improvement, especially in negative reviews. The team aims to categorize the reviews into different topics to streamline their focus on specific aspects of guest satisfaction.

1.	Define the problem and the approach
2.	 Do an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to get an overview of the dataset. Explore key statistics, distributions, and trends in the provided features such as Review created, Type of trip, gender identity, and age group. Visualize patterns and relationships that might provide initial insights into guest behavior and preferences.
3.	 Perform sentiment analysis on the Text column to determine the overall sentiment of each review. Assign a positive or negative status based on the sentiment score. This will help THEHOTEL.com to quickly gauge the overall satisfaction level of their guests.
4.	 Focus specifically on negative reviews and analyze the common themes of guest complaints. Identify keywords, phrases, or topics that appear frequently in negative reviews to pinpoint areas that need attention and improvement.
